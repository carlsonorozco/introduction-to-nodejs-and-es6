          </section>
          <section>
            <p>NodeJS uses an event-driven IO model and is designed to scale through non-blocking calls in a single threaded environment. NodeJS comes with a standard library which includes the most common utils for web and backend programming. NodeJS also comes bundled with NPM package manager.</p>

          </section>
          <section>
            <p>REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell where a command is entered and the system responds with an output in an interactive mode. </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Node.js or Node comes bundled with a REPL environment. It performs the following tasks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Read − Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.</li>
              <li>Eval − Takes and evaluates the data structure.</li>
              <li>Print − Prints the result.</li>
              <li>Loop − Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice.</li>
